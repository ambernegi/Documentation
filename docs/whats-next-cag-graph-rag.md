# What's Next: CAG & Graph RAG


## Graph-based RAG

Graph RAG leverages knowledge graphs or graph databases to enhance retrieval and reasoning. Instead of retrieving flat text chunks, it can:

- **Traverse relationships:** Find related entities, facts, or concepts.
- **Reason over data:** Use graph structure to answer complex queries.
- **Combine structured and unstructured data:** Blend graph data with traditional document retrieval for richer answers.

## Context-Aware Generation (CAG)

CAG takes Retrieval-Augmented Generation a step further by making the generation process aware of additional context, such as user history, session data, or domain-specific rules. This leads to more relevant and personalized responses.

- **Personalization:** Tailor answers based on user profile or previous interactions.
- **Session Awareness:** Maintain context across multiple queries.
- **Domain Adaptation:** Use business logic or rules to guide the LLM.



These advanced techniques unlock new possibilities for building intelligent, context-aware, and explainable AI systems. Stay tuned for more examples and tutorials!
