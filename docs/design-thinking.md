# Design Thinking Process & Impact

My approach to documentation and design is rooted in empathy, clarity, and continuous improvement. I believe that great documentation should not only inform but also empower developers to build amazing applications.

## My Design Philosophy

### User-Centered Approach

Focus on understanding the real needs and objectives of our audience, prioritizing substance over unnecessary features. Every design decision should be made with the developer experience in mind.

### Accessibility First

Over 70% developers opt for dark themes in their IDEs. Why not make the documentation also feel like home? To do that, both dark and light modes are available, ensuring comfort and accessibility for every user. Maintaining proper contrast ratios along with supporting keyboard navigation.

### Clear, Step-by-Step Journey

The documentation is structured to answer the what, why, and how of the service or API. Not everyone needs all the information.

### Write for a Wide Audience Base
A user can be a college graduate experimenting with an API for a college project, or a CTO of a big tech company. There should be enough substance for both. For example, the CTO should be able to look at documentation to understand API pricing and evaluate whether it will help their team meet next quarter's business goals.

### Users also Viewed
Based on past data and analytics and tracking browser behaviour (if possible), we can also show similar APIs or an API that a user might need after this, using a recommendation system. A section like "Also Viewed". This can be one of the strategies to get more eyes on our other APIs or services, which helps the business and also helps the user.

## Conclusion

By combining empathy, user research, iterative design, and continuous measurement, we create documentation that is not only informative but also empowering and enjoyable to use. Our design thinking process ensures that every aspect of the documentation serves the needs of our developer community.
