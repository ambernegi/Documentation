# Design Thinking Process & Impact

My approach to documentation and design is rooted in empathy, clarity, and continuous improvement. I believe that great documentation should not only inform but also empower developers or aspiring developers to build amazing applications.

## My Design Philosophy

### User-Centered Approach

Focus on understanding the real needs and objectives of our audience, prioritizing substance over unnecessary features. Every design decision should be made with the developer experience in mind.

### Accessibility First

With over 70% of developers preferring dark themes in their IDEs, documentation should feel just as welcoming. To do that, both dark and light modes are available, ensuring comfort and accessibility for every user. Proper contrast ratios, along with supporting keyboard navigation, are supported to cater to diverse preferences.

### Clear, Step-by-Step Journey

The documentation is structured to answer the what, why, and how of each service or API. Not everyone requires the same depth. The structure helps users find exactly what they need.

### Write for a Wide Audience Base
Whether a college student experimenting with an API or a CTO evaluating solutions for a large enterprise, the documentation should provide value for everyone. For example, a CTO should be able to look at documentation to understand API pricing and evaluate whether it will help their team meet next quarter's business goals.

## Ideas

### Users also Viewed
Based on past data and analytics, and tracking browser behaviour or traffic on our platforms (if possible), we can recommend similar APIs or an API that a user might need after this, using a recommendation system. A section like "Users Also Viewed". This can be one of the strategies to get more eyes on our other APIs or services, benefiting both the business and the user.

### AI Search
An AI search feature that can help a user find the exact location of the content they are looking for.

## Conclusion

By combining empathy, user research, iterative design, and continuous improvements driven by innovative ideas, we create documentation that is not only informative but also empowering and enjoyable to use. Our design thinking process ensures that every aspect of the documentation serves the needs of our developer community, demonstrating our genuine commitment to their experience.
