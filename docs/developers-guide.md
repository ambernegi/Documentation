# Developer's Guide

This guide provides an overview of Google Maps API, onboarding process, known limitations, and frequently asked questions.

## Overview

Google Maps API is a comprehensive suite of web services that enables developers to integrate location-based functionality into their applications. The platform provides access to detailed maps, geocoding services, directions, and place information.

### Key Features

- **Maps JavaScript API**: Embed interactive maps in web applications
- **Geocoding API**: Convert addresses to coordinates and vice versa
- **Directions API**: Calculate routes between locations
- **Places API**: Search for places and get detailed information
- **Distance Matrix API**: Calculate distances between multiple origins and destinations

### Architecture

Google Maps API follows a RESTful architecture:

```
Client Application → HTTPS Request → Google Maps API → JSON Response
```

All requests are made over HTTPS with JSON responses, ensuring secure and efficient communication.

## Onboarding

### Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Project

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Click "Select a project" → "New Project"
3. Enter a project name and click "Create"
4. Note your Project ID for future reference

### Step 2: Enable APIs

1. In the Google Cloud Console, go to "APIs & Services" → "Library"
2. Search for and enable the APIs you need:
   - Maps JavaScript API
   - Geocoding API
   - Directions API
   - Places API
   - Distance Matrix API

### Step 3: Create API Keys

1. Go to "APIs & Services" → "Credentials"
2. Click "Create Credentials" → "API Key"
3. Copy the generated API key
4. Click "Restrict Key" to set up security restrictions

### Step 4: Set Up Billing

1. Go to "Billing" in Google Cloud Console
2. Link a billing account to your project
3. Set up budget alerts to monitor usage

### Step 5: Test Your Setup

=== "Python"
    ```python
    import requests

    def test_api_setup(api_key):
        """Test if your API key is working."""
        url = "https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json"
        params = {
            "address": "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA",
            "key": api_key
        }

    response = requests.get(url, params=params)
        data = response.json()

    if data["status"] == "OK":
            print("✅ API key is working correctly!")
            return True
        else:
            print(f"❌ API key error: {data['status']}")
            return False

    # Test your API key
    test_api_setup("YOUR_API_KEY")
    ```

=== "Java"
    ```java
    import java.net.http.HttpClient;
    import java.net.http.HttpRequest;
    import java.net.http.HttpResponse;
    import java.net.URI;

    public class APITest {
        public static boolean testApiSetup(String apiKey) throws Exception {
            String url = String.format(
                "https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=%s&key=%s",
                "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA",
                apiKey
            );

    HttpClient client = HttpClient.newHttpClient();
            HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
                .uri(URI.create(url))
                .build();

    HttpResponse`<String>` response = client.send(request,
                HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());

    if (response.body().contains("\"status\":\"OK\"")) {
                System.out.println("✅ API key is working correctly!");
                return true;
            } else {
                System.out.println("❌ API key error: " + response.body());
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    ```

## Known Limitations

### Rate Limits

| Service             | Free Tier Limit    | Paid Tier Limit      |
| ------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- |
| Geocoding API       | 2,500 requests/day | 100,000 requests/day |
